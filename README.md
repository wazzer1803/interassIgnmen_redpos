Just clone the whole project  in your desktop and run it in two terminal one for the front end one for the backend . Install the required packages using npm install --legacy-peer-deps.
For frontend  go into the directory and run npm run dev in the terminal . For the backend go into the BACKEND directory and run npm start to start the connection to the database . 
Enjoy
